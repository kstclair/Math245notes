# Review of Statistical Inference {#review}

Suppose we take a random sample of size $n$ from a large population of individuals. We record a variable and compute a **statistic** like a sample mean or sample proportion from this data. The **sampling distribution** of the statistic describes how the stat is distributed over many random samples:
1. collect a random sample of size $n$
2. record the variable of interest (data)
3. compute the statistic from the data
4. repeat 1-3 many, many times
5. plot the distribution of your statistics from step 4.

## Central Limit Theorem
Under the right conditions, the distribution of many sample means $\bar{x}$ or proportions  $\hat{p}$ will look like a normal distribution that is centered at the true population parameter (mean $\mu$ or proportion $p$) value. 

- Shape: normally distributed ("bell-shaped")
- Center: true population parameter value
- Variation: called the **standard error** of the statistic which measures the standard deviation of your statistic over many samples

The conditions for "normality" (symmetry) have to do with both the sample sized and the distribution of your variable.

- If your measurements are very symmetric (e.g. heights of woman in an adult population) then the sample size $n$ can be very small and the sample mean will behave normally.
- As your measurements get more skewed (e.g. income per person in a large city), then the sample size $n$ needs to get larger for the sample mean to behave normally.
- Outliers are always a problem, even if you have a large sample size, since means can be easily influenced by one or two very unusual cases. 

### Standard error
The standard error of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ measures the variability of this statistic and is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$. Roughly, the SE of any statistic tells us how it will vary from sample to sample. 

For the sample mean statistic, the SE is equal to 
$$
SE(\bar{x}) = \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the **population standard deviation** of your variable. For the **difference of two sample means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, the standard error is
$$
SE(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1} + \dfrac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}}
$$
where $n_i$ is the sample size of sample $i$ and $\sigma_i$ is the population SD of population $i$. 

For the sample proportion $\hat{p}$, the standard error is 
$$
SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$
where $p$ is the true population proportion.

## Hypothesis testing

The sampling distribution is used to compute the p-value in a hypothesis test by assuming the null is true and comparing the observed results to what we expect under the null. 

## Confidence Intervals

The sampling distribution is used to construct the correct margin of error for any level of "confidence". The usual CI form is  estimate $\pm$ margin of error. The margin of error is computed so that, say, 95% of the time the estimate will be within the "margin of error" of the truth. A rough guess at a 95% margin of error is $2\times SE$.
