# Getting Started {-#Getting-Started}


This manual is designed to provide students in Math 245 (Applied Regression Analysis) with supplemental notes and examples. 

## Getting help {-}

Try to start your homework or projects early enough to seek help from me! You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Office visit: Stop by office hours or drop by anytime my door is open. This is the easiest way for me to answer any class questions that you have or help you debug troublesome R code.
- Email: I can usually clarify any homework questions over email. If you are running in an R problem, you should snapshot your R code and error and send it to me via email. I can often figure out your code issue this way!
- Stats Lab: Visit the stats lab assistants in CMC 201 for help using R.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
